Scripting and Automation Task 1

For this task I had to create a PowerShell script. PowerShell enables administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote systems. This script contains scripting standards and uses exception and exit handling where appropriate.
The completed product will prompt the user for input to complete various tasks until the user selects a prompt to exit the script.
